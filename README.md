# About

Data analysis project on a fictional bank customer dataset of 10,000 unique customers, whereby churn rates are analyzed through data visualization using Tableau. The aim of the project is to identify pain points of the bank's business and services by investigating the demographics that have high churn rates. 

# Insights

- Customers aged within the **40-60 range** have particularly high churn rates
- Churn rate is significantly higher for customers with **3 or more products**
- Out of 3 countries that the bank operates in, **Germany** has the highest churn rate
- **Diamond card holders** tend to have higher churn rates than other card holders
- Churn rate is generally unaffected by Tenure, Satisfaction Score and Number of Points Earned. 

# Conclusions

Services targeted at the 40-60 year old demographic can be added or further improved. Identify whether certain products are being pushed for sale to customers from the third product onwards that are deemed unnecessary or undesirable by customers. It is also worthy to investigate the bank's services in Germany as a whole, through surveys with existing customers and service comparison with competitors, to pinpoint the reasons for poor performance in the country.  Additional incentives or services can be provided to diamond card holders, possibly through more attractive rewards from using higher-end goods and services.
